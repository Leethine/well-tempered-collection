# Well-tempered Collection

Welcome to the _Well-tempered Collection_, this is a music score collection for keyboard instruments, generated by [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/).

I created this repository to share the source codes of my favourite pieces during my piano learning progress. You may see this as a kind of "learning note", so as my level goes up, more pieces will be added.

The pieces are categorized in the order of difficulty, and all beginner level pieces are provided with fingering.

The benefit of using Lilypond is obvious: it is robust and versatile, meaning that not only we can generate beautiful scores, but we will also be able to analyze the music source in a programmable way. Talk is cheap, let's see the code ;)

Feel free to share, comment and contribute!

## 我的鋼琴學習曲集
本項目是我在學習鋼琴過程中所遇到的曲目集合,以[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/)源代碼的形式分享.

隨着我的學習深入,更高難度的曲子也會隨之加入,我會儘量給曲子劃分難度等級並加入指法.
