# Well-Tempered Collection

Welcome to the _Well-tempered Collection_, this is my music score collection for keyboard instruments, generated by [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/).

I created this repository to share the source codes of my favourite pieces during my piano learning process. You may see this as my "study notes", as my level goes up, more pieces will be added and the difficulty will be increased.

I will sort the pieces so that they are categorized by difficulty, style, composer, etc., and the beginner level pieces are provided with fingering.

The benefit of using Lilypond is obvious: it is robust and versatile, meaning that not only we can generate beautiful scores, but we will also be able to analyze the music source in a programmable way. Talk is cheap, let's see the code ;)

Feel free to share, comment and contribute!

## 我的鋼琴學習曲集
本項目是我在學習鋼琴過程中所遇到的曲目集合,以[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/)源代碼的形式分享.

隨着我的學習深入,更高難度的曲子也會隨之加入,我會儘量給曲子劃分難度等級並加入指法.
