# Well-tempered Collection
## 我的鋼琴學習曲集

Welcome to the _Well-tempered Collection_, this is a sheet music collection for Klavier instruments, generated by [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/).

I created this repository to share the source codes of my favourite pieces during my piano learning progress. You may see this as a kind of "learning note", so as my level goes up, more pieces will be added.

The pieces are categorized in the order of difficulty, and all beginner level pieces are provided with fingering.

Feel free to share, comment and contribute!
