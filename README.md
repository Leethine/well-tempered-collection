# Well-Tempered Collection

### Introduction
Welcome to the _Well-Tempered Collection_, this is my music score collection for keyboard instruments, edited with [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/).

This repository is created to share the source codes of my favourite pieces during my piano learning process. You may consider this as my "self-made study book". As my level goes up, more pieces will be added and the difficulty will be increased.

To facilitate other piano learners, I created json files in order to manage the library with [my automated tool](https://github.com/Leethine/hautbois-omslp).

The benefit of Lilypond is obvious: it is robust and versatile, meaning that not only we can generate beautiful scores, but we will also be able to analyze the music source in a programmable way. Talk is cheap, let's see the code ;)

Feel free to share, comment and contribute!

### Structure & organization

The repo is devided into 3 directories:

- **original** : contains pieces originally written for keyboard instruments (harpsichord, organ, pianoforte)
- **arrangements** : pieces arranged for piano
- **collection** : my personal selection of works

### Priority & preference

Here are some aesthetic rules that I create new scores:

- Classical only
- Educational pieces are encouraged
- Fugue prioritized
- Separated works not recommended

Contribution from the community is welcomed without limitation on the author or style, any classical music pieces will be accepted.

## 我的鋼琴學習曲集

#### 簡介

本項目是我在學習鋼琴過程中所遇到的曲目，製作成樂譜，以[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/)源代碼的形式分享。這樣做的好處是方便日後對於樂譜的修改和維護。

每個曲集都有json文件用以描述樂譜的信息，可以配合自動化腳本使用，也便於日後擴增方便維護。

#### 目錄和組織

本項目有三個主要目錄:

- **original** : 原版鍵盤類曲目
- **arrangements** : 改編曲目
- **collection** : 精選曲目集合

#### 曲目偏好

- 僅限古典
- 有教育意義的曲目優先
- 賦格優先
- 不建議零散曲目
